Me, playing with the Commodore LCD, after I wrote the world's first working
Commodore LCD emulator. ROM extractor expert ;) -> Mike Naberezny

Things to try:

In BASIC:

  SYS 64007	    - resets the machine?
  POKE 63488,255    - powers off the CLCD?

The bin/ directory within this repository:

  clcd-rom.bin		Replace U104 or U105 with an EPROM with this content.
			The CLCD should boot, and display an "lgb" title in
			the SHELL menu, which can be selected. The result
			should be similar to this one (online emulator):

			http://commodore-lcd.lgb.hu/j/?test=yoda

  loadable.prg		Should be LOADed from BASIC. Must be RUN then.

  old-clcd-myrom.bin	It can be ignored, my old reference ROM, I lost
			the source of, thus I had to disassemble my
			own program again ...
