Me, playing with the Commodore LCD, after I wrote the world's first working
Commodore LCD emulator.

As always, thanks to Mike Naberezny for arranging various "ROM extraction
parties" from the few CLCD owners we have ;)

Note: this repository is only a collection of some very quick & ugly hacks
to have something to test on real CLCDs.

Things to try:

In BASIC:

  SYS 64007	    - resets the machine?
  POKE 63488,255    - powers off the CLCD?

  Some gfx:

  10 GRAPHIC1,1
  20 CIRCLE,240,64,230,60
  30 GET A$
  40 IF A$="" THEN 30
  50 GRAPHIC0
  RUN

The bin/ directory within this repository:

  --- My stupid "Yoda" ... well ... "demo" in various forms ---

  clcd-rom.bin		Replace U104 or U105 with an EPROM with this content.
			The CLCD should boot, and display an "lgb" title in
			the SHELL menu, which can be selected. The result
			should be similar to this one (online emulator):

			http://commodore-lcd.lgb.hu/j/?test=yoda

  clcd-kernal.bin       Replacement KERNAL for U102. This is a 32K image,
			simply duplicated version of clcd-kernal.bin.16k

  clcd-kernal.bin.16k	Replacement KERNAL for U102. This is a 16K image.

  loadable.prg		Should be LOADed from BASIC. Must be RUN then.

  disk.d81		3.5" D81 disk image, contains PRG files,
			currently loadable.prg (as name 'yoda').

  old-clcd-myrom.bin	It can be ignored, my old reference ROM, I lost
			the source of, thus I had to disassemble my
			own program again ...
